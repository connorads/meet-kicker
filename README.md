> A Chrome Extension to quickly kick people out of Google Meet at random ðŸ¦¶

[![Add to Chrome](https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-gcs-uploader.appspot.com/image/WlD8wC6g8khYWPJUsQceQkhXSlv1/UV4C4ybeBTsZt43U4xis.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meet-kicker-%F0%9F%A6%B6/aonhapalnnnjlonafnammcbnafmafmpg)

âš  May need to restart your browser after installation

1. Click on the Meet Kicker extension icon to kick someone at random
2. Keep kicking until you have no friends left
